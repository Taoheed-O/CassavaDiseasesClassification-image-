## Cassava Diseases Classification

### Image classification using Machine Learning Approach.
### This takes in images from a folder and train the model with 80% of the images with 5 different classes:
    - Cassava Bacteria Blight
    - Cassava Brown Streak Virus
    - Cassava Green Mite
    - Cassava Mosaic Disease
    - Healthy
### A class called MasterImage was used in the project to load the image files and then splitted using the sklearn train_test_split with randim state=23 and test_size=0.2.
### The project made use of three algorithms:
    - Random Forest
    - Naive Bayes
    - K Nearest Neighbor
    - support vector machine
    - xtreme gradient boosting
### of which Random Forest was the better model.
